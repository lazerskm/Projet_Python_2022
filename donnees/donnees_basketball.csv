Gonzaga bound SG Dusty stormer apparently 20years old, not 6ft 6 and Could possibly be no longer playing for Norte Dame Knights in the future.;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472107D90>];2022-11-02 08:42:16;https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/yjyrn0/gonzaga_bound_sg_dusty_stormer_apparently_20years/;After a couple of recent talks in highshcool mixing parties I’ve gathered all the rumors and topic gossp surprising future prospect Dusty stormer attending notre dame  highschool, I ve heard gossip or rumors of peculiar things circulating Dusty. For one apparently he no longer attends school for 5 days a week and usually shows up around 2-3 days and instead goes on vacations with his girlfriend according to student gossip. Apparently the coach for the basketball team has made some very personal and idiotic decisions towards his players. One player was going to transfer out of ND, however before decided to he asked if the coach would play him for his senior year, the coach apparently promised him this role to only 3 days after the transfer deadline recruit 2 five star players that replaced his specific players role. Currently as of now the state of the team is up in the air due to the coaches mistreatment of this specific player. Out of all the rumors I find believable as a reason for Dusty to drop out of highschool, the dude is barley there, and already knows where he is going. To address less crucial  rumors, some people claimed that Dusty really wasn’t 6ft 6 and most likely 6ft 4.5 according to some taller end students. Which currently doesn’t mean much, but if he ever gets drafted expect him to shrink 1-2 inches. Another person said that Dusty was secretly 20 years of age, due to him driving to school as freshman, which would have made him a 16 year old 9th grader. All that being said in the end these are just rumors, probably over exaggeration due to envy. I guess what I’m trying to say here is people like to see people as sucked up as Dusty fail, because they wish they had his situation instead.

A key challenge lies in the fact that the evaluation metric is highly subjective and specific to a particular evaluator. We leverage the first-person camera to address this challenge. The spatiotemporal visual semantics provided by a first-person view allows us to reason about the camera wearer's actions while he/she is participating in an unscripted basketball game. Our method takes a player's first-person video and provides a player's performance measure that is specific to an evaluator's preference.   To achieve this goal, we first use a convolutional LSTM network to detect atomic basketball events from first-person videos. Our network's ability to zoom-in to the salient regions addresses the issue of a severe camera wearer's head movement in first-person videos. The detected atomic events are then passed through the Gaussian mixtures to construct a highly non-linear visual spatiotemporal basketball assessment feature. Finally, we use this feature to learn a basketball assessment model from pairs of labeled first-person basketball videos, for which a basketball expert indicates, which of the two players is better.   We demonstrate that despite not knowing the basketball evaluator's criterion, our model learns to accurately assess the players in real-world games. Furthermore, our model can also discover basketball events that contribute positively and negatively to a player's performance.
"Application of Monte Carlo Simulations to Improve Basketball Shooting
  Strategy";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020471F294F0>];2016-06-27 07:28:34;http://dx.doi.org/10.3938/jkps.69.1139;The underlying physics of basketball shooting seems to be a straightforward example of the Newtonian mechanics that can easily be traced by numerical methods. However, a human basketball player does not make use of all the possible basketball trajectories. Instead, a basketball player will build up a database of successful shots and select the trajectory that has the greatest tolerance to small variations of the real world. We simulate the basketball player's shooting training as a Monte Carlo sequence to build optimal shooting strategies, such as the launch speed and angle of the basketball, and whether to take a direct shot or a bank shot, as a function of the player's court positions and height. The phase space volume that belongs to the successful launch velocities generated by Monte Carlo simulations are then used as the criterion to optimize a shooting strategy that incorporates not only mechanical, but human factors as well.
A Continuous-time Stochastic Block Model for Basketball Networks;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020471F29EE0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020471EB4F70>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020471EB4F10>];2015-07-04 20:14:45;http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01816v2;For professional basketball, finding valuable and suitable players is the key to building a winning team. To deal with such challenges, basketball managers, scouts and coaches are increasingly turning to analytics. Objective evaluation of players and teams has always been the top goal of basketball analytics. Typical statistical analytics mainly focuses on the box score and has developed various metrics. In spite of the more and more advanced methods, metrics built upon box score statistics provide limited information about how players interact with each other. Two players with similar box scores may deliver distinct team plays. Thus professional basketball scouts have to watch real games to evaluate players. Live scouting is effective, but suffers from inefficiency and subjectivity. In this paper, we go beyond the static box score and model basketball games as dynamic networks. The proposed Continuous-time Stochastic Block Model clusters the players according to their playing style and performance. The model provides cluster-specific estimates of the effectiveness of players at scoring, rebounding, stealing, etc, and also captures player interaction patterns within and between clusters. By clustering similar players together, the model can help basketball scouts to narrow down the search space. Moreover, the model is able to reveal the subtle differences in the offensive strategies of different teams. An application to NBA basketball games illustrates the performance of the model.

The prediction is a binary classification problem, predicting whether a match finishes 1 (home win) or 2 (away win). Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the ""wisdom of the basketball crowd"" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study. We argue why the accuracy level of this group of ""experts"" should be set as the benchmark for future studies in the prediction of (European) basketball games using machine learning."
"Fever Basketball: A Complex, Flexible, and Asynchronized Sports Game

However, many existing environments lack complexity and flexibility and assume the actions are synchronously executed in multi-agent settings, which become less valuable. We introduce the Fever Basketball game, a novel reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play basketball game. It is a complex and challenging environment that supports multiple characters, multiple positions, and both the single-agent and multi-agent player control modes. In addition, to better simulate real-world basketball games, the execution time of actions differs among players, which makes Fever Basketball a novel asynchronized environment. We evaluate commonly used multi-agent algorithms of both independent learners and joint-action learners in three game scenarios with varying difficulties, and heuristically propose two baseline methods to diminish the extra non-stationarity brought by asynchronism in Fever Basketball Benchmarks. Besides, we propose an integrated curricula training (ICT) framework to better handle Fever Basketball problems, which includes several game-rule based cascading curricula learners and a coordination curricula switcher focusing on enhancing coordination within the team. The results show that the game remains challenging and can be used as a benchmark environment for studies like long-time horizon, sparse rewards, credit assignment, and non-stationarity, etc. in multi-agent settings.

To do this, we first introduce a future convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts an initial sequence of 12D camera configurations, aiming to capture how real players move during a one-on-one basketball game. We also introduce a goal verifier network, which is trained to verify that a given camera configuration is consistent with the final goals of real one-on-one basketball players. Next, we propose an inverse synthesis procedure to synthesize a refined sequence of 12D camera configurations that (1) sufficiently matches the initial configurations predicted by the future CNN, while (2) maximizing the output of the goal verifier network. Finally, by following the trajectory resulting from the refined camera configuration sequence, we obtain the complete 12D motion sequence.   Our model generates realistic basketball motion sequences that capture the goals of real players, outperforming standard deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

While numerous visual analytics systems have been developed for sports analysts to derive insights, few tools target fans to improve their understanding and engagement of sports data during live games. By presenting extra data in the actual game views, embedded visualization has the potential to enhance fans' game-viewing experience. However, little is known about how to design such kinds of visualizations embedded into live games. In this work, we present a user-centered design study of developing interactive embedded visualizations for basketball fans to improve their live game-watching experiences. We first conducted a formative study to characterize basketball fans' in-game analysis behaviors and tasks. Based on our findings, we propose a design framework to inform the design of embedded visualizations based on specific data-seeking contexts. Following the design framework, we present five novel embedded visualization designs targeting five representative contexts identified by the fans, including shooting, offense, defense, player evaluation, and team comparison. We then developed Omnioculars, an interactive basketball game-viewing prototype that features the proposed embedded visualizations for fans' in-game data analysis. We evaluated Omnioculars in a simulated basketball game with basketball fans. The study results suggest that our design supports personalized in-game data analysis and enhances game understanding and engagement.

The price of anarchy in basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721059D0>];2009-08-12 21:37:23;http://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1559-0410.1217;"Optimizing the performance of a basketball offense may be viewed as a network problem, wherein each play represents a ""pathway"" through which the ball and players may move from origin (the in-bounds pass) to goal (the basket). Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions of the ""price of anarchy"" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball, such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of the team's offensive efficiency."
Random Walk Picture of Basketball Scoring;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472105B50>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472105BE0>];2011-09-13 15:22:05;http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1559-0410.1416;We present evidence, based on play-by-play data from all 6087 games from the 2006/07--2009/10 seasons of the National Basketball Association (NBA), that basketball scoring is well described by a weakly-biased continuous-time random walk. The time between successive scoring events follows an exponential distribution, with little memory between different scoring intervals. Using this random-walk picture that is augmented by features idiosyncratic to basketball, we account for a wide variety of statistical properties of scoring, such as the distribution of the score difference between opponents and the fraction of game time that one team is in the lead. By further including the heterogeneity of team strengths, we build a computational model that accounts for essentially all statistical features of game scoring data and season win/loss records of each team.
"Is coaching experience associated with effective use of timeouts in
  basketball?";[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210C970>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210CA00>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210CA60>];2012-05-07 19:45:21;http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep00676;Experience is an important asset in almost any professional activity. In basketball, there is believed to be a positive association between coaching experience and effective use of team timeouts. Here, we analyze both the extent to which a team's change in scoring margin per possession after timeouts deviate from the team's average scoring margin per possession---what we called timeout factor, and the extent to which this performance measure is associated with coaching experience across all teams in the National Basketball Association over the 2009-2012 seasons. We find that timeout factor plays a minor role in the scoring dynamics of basketball. Surprisingly, we find that timeout factor is negatively associated with coaching experience. Our findings support empirical studies showing that, under certain conditions, mentors early in their careers can have a stronger positive impact on their teams than later in their careers.
"A Multiresolution Stochastic Process Model for Predicting Basketball

However, current analyses of basketball outcomes rely on discretized summaries of the game that reduce such interactions to tallies of points, assists, and similar events. In this paper, we propose a framework for using optical player tracking data to estimate, in real time, the expected number of points obtained by the end of a possession. This quantity, called \textit{expected possession value} (EPV), derives from a stochastic process model for the evolution of a basketball possession; we model this process at multiple levels of resolution, differentiating between continuous, infinitesimal movements of players, and discrete events such as shot attempts and turnovers. Transition kernels are estimated using hierarchical spatiotemporal models that share information across players while remaining computationally tractable on very large data sets. In addition to estimating EPV, these models reveal novel insights on players' decision-making tendencies as a function of their spatial strategy."

We extend a state-of-the-art multi-resolution stochastic process approach to modeling basketball by modeling passes between teammates as directed dynamic relational links on a network and introduce multiplicative latent factors to study higher-order patterns in players' interactions that distinguish a successful game from a loss. Parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Results in simulation experiments suggest that the sampling scheme is effective in recovering the parameters. We then apply the model to the first high-resolution optical tracking dataset collected in college basketball games. The learned latent factors demonstrate significant differences between players' passing and receiving tendencies in a loss than those in a win. The model is applicable to team sports other than basketball, as well as other time-varying network observations.
"An Investigation of Three-point Shooting through an Analysis of NBA
  Player Tracking Data";[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210CF10>];2017-03-21 02:45:23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07030v1;I address the difficult challenge of measuring the relative influence of competing basketball game strategies, and I apply my analysis to plays resulting in three-point shots. I use a glut of SportVU player tracking data from over 600 NBA games to derive custom position-based features that capture tangible game strategies from game-play data, such as teamwork, player matchups, and on-ball defender distances. Then, I demonstrate statistical methods for measuring the relative importance of any given basketball strategy. In doing so, I highlight the high importance of teamwork based strategies in affecting three-point shot success. By coupling SportVU data with an advanced variable importance algorithm I am able to extract meaningful results that would have been impossible to achieve even 3 years ago. Further, I demonstrate how player-tracking based features can be used to measure the three- point shooting propensity of players, and I show how this measurement can identify effective shooters that are either highly-utilized or under-utilized. Altogether, my findings provide a substantial body of work for influencing basketball strategy, and for measuring the effectiveness of basketball players.

In this review, we focus on methods for quantifying and characterizing basketball gameplay. At the team level, we discuss methods for characterizing team strategy and performance, while at the player level, we take a deep look into a myriad of tools for player evaluation. This includes metrics for overall player value, defensive ability, and shot modeling, and methods for understanding performance over multiple seasons via player production curves. We conclude with a discussion on the future of basketball analytics, and in particular highlight the need for causal inference in sports.

However, conventional methods always utilize isolated statistical data, leading to ineffective and inaccurate evaluations. Existing models based on dynamic network theory offer major improvements to the results of such evaluations, but said models remain imprecise because they focus merely on evaluating the values of individual players rather than considering them within their current teams. To solve this problem, we propose an analysis and evaluation model based on networks and a hidden Markov model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine a network form representing the players who are playing with the use of a hidden Markov model to mine the network and generate the desired results. Applying our approach to SportVU data collected from the National Basketball Association shows that this analysis and evaluation model can effectively analyze the performance of each player in a game and provides an assistive tool for team managers.

  basketball";[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721024C0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472102520>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472102580>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721025E0>];2014-05-01 17:39:21;http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-AOAS799;Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on both offense and defense, almost all of the sport's conventional metrics are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals, blocks and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness, yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe. Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis that can be prone to human biases and imprecision. Fortunately, emerging optical player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet. This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes, matrix factorization techniques and hierarchical regression models with player tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach detects, characterizes and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball, supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball.

Similarly, every complex polynomial gives rise to a related combinatorial object that we call a basketball, consisting of a pair of noncrossing matchings satisfying one additional constraint. We prove that every noncrossing matching arises from some harmonic curve, and deduce from this that every basketball arises from some polynomial."

Results allowed us to identify differences in spacing among players, distinguish defensive or offensive actions, analyze transition probabilities from a certain group to another one.
Is Basketball a Game of Runs?;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472102B80>];2019-03-20 20:01:09;http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08716v1;"Basketball is often referred to as ""a game of runs.""

Our results consistently indicate that the lengths of longest runs in NBA games are no longer than those that would occur naturally when scoring events are generated by a random process, rather than one that is influenced by ""momentum""."

Despite this recognized central role, the main part of the studies on this topic focus on performance level measurement, neglecting other important characteristics, such as variability. In this paper, shooting performance variability is modeled with a Markov Switching dynamic, assuming the existence of two alternating performance regimes. Then, the relationships between each player's variability and the lineup composition is modeled as an ARIMA process with covariates and described with network analysis tools, in order to extrapolate positive and negative interactions between teammates
Continuous-time state-space modelling of the hot hand in basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472102EE0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472102F40>];2020-11-09 12:34:40;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04384v1;We investigate the hot hand phenomenon using data on 110,513 free throws taken in the National Basketball Association (NBA). As free throws occur at unevenly spaced time points within a game, we consider a state-space model formulated in continuous time to investigate serial dependence in players' success probabilities. In particular, the underlying state process can be interpreted as a player's (latent) varying form and is modelled using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our results support the existence of the hot hand, but the magnitude of the estimated effect is rather small.

The problem of shot selection in basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472103220>];2011-07-28 19:01:58;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0030776;"In basketball, every time the offense produces a shot opportunity the player with the ball must decide whether the shot is worth taking. In this paper, I explore the question of when a team should shoot and when they should pass up the shot by considering a simple theoretical model of the shot selection process, in which the quality of shot opportunities generated by the offense is assumed to fall randomly within a uniform distribution. I derive an answer to the question ""how likely must the shot be to go in before the player should take it?"", and show that this ""lower cutoff"" for shot quality $f$ depends crucially on the number $n$ of shot opportunities remaining (say, before the shot clock expires), with larger $n$ demanding that only higher-quality shots should be taken. The function $f(n)$ is also derived in the presence of a finite turnover rate and used to predict the shooting rate of an optimal-shooting team as a function of time. This prediction is compared to observed shooting rates from the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the comparison suggests that NBA players tend to wait too long before shooting and undervalue the probability of committing a turnover."

Motion patterns can be an effective means to identify different activities. Global and local motions have their respective emphasis on different activities, which are difficult to capture from the optical flow due to the mixture of global and local motions. Hence it calls for a more effective way to separate the global and local motions. When it comes to the specific case for basketball game analysis, the successful score for each round can be reliably detected by the appearance variation around the basket. Based on the observations, we propose a scheme to fuse global and local motion patterns (MPs) and key visual information (KVI) for semantic event recognition in basketball videos. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to estimate the global motions from the mixed motions based on the intrinsic property of camera adjustments. And the local motions could be obtained from the mixed and global motions. Secondly, a two-stream 3D CNN framework is utilized for group activity recognition over the separated global and local motion patterns. Thirdly, the basket is detected and its appearance features are extracted through a CNN structure. The features are utilized to predict the success or failure. Finally, the group activity recognition and success/failure prediction results are integrated using the kronecker product for event recognition. Experiments on NCAA dataset demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance.

Given an offensive set play sketch, our method simulates potential scenarios that may occur in the game. The simulation provides coaches and players with insights on how a given set play can be executed. To achieve the goal, we train a conditional adversarial network on NBA movement data to imitate the behaviors of how players move around the court through two major components: a generator that learns to generate natural player movements based on a latent noise and a user sketched set play; and a discriminator that is used to evaluate the realism of the basketball play. To improve the quality of simulation, we minimize 1.) a dribbler loss to prevent the ball from drifting away from the dribbler; 2.) a defender loss to prevent the dribbler from not being defended; 3.) a ball passing loss to ensure the straightness of passing trajectories; and 4) an acceleration loss to minimize unnecessary players' movements. To evaluate our system, we objectively compared real and simulated basketball set plays. Besides, a subjective test was conducted to judge whether a set play was real or generated by our network. On average, the mean correct rates to the binary tests were 56.17 \%. Experiment results and the evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of our system."
"The role of intrinsic dimension in high-resolution player tracking data

However, this high dimensional data is often challenging for statistical inference and decision making. In this article, we employ Hidalgo, a state-of-the-art Bayesian mixture model that allows the estimation of heterogeneous intrinsic dimensions (ID) within a dataset and propose some theoretical enhancements. ID results can be interpreted as indicators of variability and complexity of basketball plays and games. This technique allows classification and clustering of NBA basketball player's movement and shot charts data. Analyzing movement data, Hidalgo identifies key stages of offensive actions such as creating space for passing, preparation/shooting and following through. We found that the ID value spikes reaching a peak between 4 and 8 seconds in the offensive part of the court after which it declines. In shot charts, we obtained groups of shots that produce substantially higher and lower successes. Overall, game-winners tend to have a larger intrinsic dimension which is an indication of more unpredictability and unique shot placements. Similarly, we found higher ID values in plays when the score margin is small compared to large margin ones. These outcomes could be exploited by coaches to obtain better offensive/defensive results.
Optimal Strategy in Basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472103B50>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472103C70>];2015-12-17 16:10:51;http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05652v1;This book chapter reviews some of the major principles associated with optimal strategy in basketball. In particular, we consider the principles of allocative efficiency (optimal allocation of shots between offensive options), dynamic efficiency (optimal shot selection in the face of pressure from the shot clock), and the risk/reward tradeoff (strategic manipulation of outcome variance). For each principle, we provide a simple example of a strategic problem and show how it can be described analytically. We then review general analytical results and provide an overview of existing statistical studies. A number of open challenges in basketball analysis are highlighted.
Statistics-Free Sports Prediction;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472103C40>];2015-12-21 14:02:01;http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07208v3;"We use a simple machine learning model, logistically-weighted regularized linear least squares regression, in order to predict baseball, basketball, football, and hockey games. We do so using only the thirty-year record of which visiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final score was. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likely because it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in football and hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to a theoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle be made much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. These findings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by the scores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and player statistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done. Baseball and hockey lie somewhere in between."
Bifurcation Adds Flavor to Basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472103D30>];2016-10-24 01:53:40;http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07259v4;We report an emergence of bifurcation in basketball, a single-particle system governed by Newtonian mechanics. When shooting the basketball, the obvious control parameters are the launch speed and the launch angle. We propose to use the three-dimensional velocity phase-space volume associated with the given launch parameters to quantify the difficulty of the shooting. The optimal launch angle that maximizes the associated phase-space volume undergoes a bifurcation as the launch speed is increased, if the shooter is farther than a critical distance away from the hoop. Thus, the bifurcation makes it very important to control the launch speed accurately. If the air resistance is removed, the bifurcation disappears and the phase-space volume distribution becomes dispersionless and shrinks in magnitude.

However, manual data collection and analytics are costly and ineffective. Therefore, we applied a deep bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and mixture density network (MDN) approach. This model is not only capable of predicting a basketball trajectory based on real data, but it also can generate new trajectory samples. It is an excellent application to help coaches and players decide when and where to shoot. Its structure is particularly suitable for dealing with time series problems. BLSTM receives forward and backward information at the same time, while stacking multiple BLSTMs further increases the learning ability of the model. Combined with BLSTMs, MDN is used to generate a multi-modal distribution of outputs. Thus, the proposed model can, in principle, represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions of output variables. We tested our model with two experiments on three-pointer datasets from NBA SportVu data. In the hit-or-miss classification experiment, the proposed model outperformed other models in terms of the convergence speed and accuracy. In the trajectory generation experiment, eight model-generated trajectories at a given time closely matched real trajectories.
Filtering Procedures for Sensor Data in Basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210D130>];2018-06-27 11:20:31;http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10412v1;Big Data Analytics help team sports' managers in their decisions by processing a number of different kind of data. With the advent of Information Technologies, collecting, processing and storing big amounts of sport data in different form became possible. A problem that often arises when using sport data regards the need for automatic data cleaning procedures. In this paper we develop a data cleaning procedure for basketball which is based on players' trajectories. Starting from a data matrix that tracks the movements of the players on the court at different moments in the game, we propose an algorithm to automatically drop inactive moments making use of available sensor data. The algorithm also divides the game into sorted actions and labels them as offensive or defensive. The algorithm's parameters are validated using proper robustness checks.

Previous approaches to similar problems center on hand-crafting features to capture domain specific knowledge. Although intuitive, recent work in deep learning has shown this approach is prone to missing important predictive features. To circumvent this issue, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach where we initially represent the multiagent behavior as an image. To encode the adversarial nature of basketball, we use a multi-channel image which we then feed into a CNN. Additionally, to capture the temporal aspect of the trajectories we ""fade"" the player trajectories. We find that this approach is superior to a traditional FFN model. By using gradient ascent to create images using an already trained CNN, we discover what features the CNN filters learn. Last, we find that a combined CNN+FFN is the best performing network with an error rate of 39%."

When modeling such settings, it is often beneficial to design hierarchical models that can capture long-term coordination using intermediate variables. Furthermore, these intermediate variables should capture interesting high-level behavioral semantics in an interpretable and manipulatable way. We present a hierarchical framework that can effectively learn such sequential generative models. Our approach is inspired by recent work on leveraging programmatically produced weak labels, which we extend to the spatiotemporal regime. In addition to synthetic settings, we show how to instantiate our framework to effectively model complex interactions between basketball players and generate realistic multi-agent trajectories of basketball gameplay over long time periods. We validate our approach using both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study comparison conducted with professional sports analysts.

This paper attempts to answer this question using data from the 2014 men's basketball tournament and more than 400 predictions of game outcomes submitted to a contest hosted by the website Kaggle. We begin by describing how we built a prediction model for men's basketball tournament outcomes under the binomial log-likelihood loss function. Next, under different sets of true underlying game probabilities, we simulate tournament outcomes and imputed pool standings, in an effort to determine how much of an entry's success can be attributed to luck. While one of our two submissions finished first in the Kaggle contest, we estimate that this winning entry had no more than about a 12% chance of doing so, even under the most optimistic of game probability scenarios.

This paper presents an analysis of several geometric and semantic visual features to detect and track basketball players. An ablation study is carried out and then used to remark that a robust tracker can be built with Deep Learning features, without the need of extracting contextual ones, such as proximity or color similarity, nor applying camera stabilization techniques. The presented tracker consists of: (1) a detection step, which uses a pretrained deep learning model to estimate the players pose, followed by (2) a tracking step, which leverages pose and semantic information from the output of a convolutional layer in a VGG network. Its performance is analyzed in terms of MOTA over a basketball dataset with more than 10k instances.

Yet, state-of-the-art results still suffer from errors due to challenging body poses, modeling clothing, and self occlusions. The domain of basketball games is particularly challenging, as it exhibits all of these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for reconstruction of basketball players that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Key to our approach is a new method for creating poseable, skinned models of NBA players, and a large database of meshes (derived from the NBA2K19 video game), that we are releasing to the research community. Based on these models, we introduce a new method that takes as input a single photo of a clothed player in any basketball pose and outputs a high resolution mesh and 3D pose for that player. We demonstrate substantial improvement over state-of-the-art, single-image methods for body shape reconstruction.

Bayesian hierarchical models are employed in the modeling and parametrization of the transition probabilities to borrow strength across players and through time. To enable computational feasibility, we combine lineup-specific MDPs into team-average MDPs using a novel transition weighting scheme. Specifically, we derive the dynamics of the team-average process such that the expected transition count for an arbitrary state-pair is equal to the weighted sum of the expected counts of the separate lineup-specific MDPs.   We then utilize these non-stationary MDPs in the creation of a basketball play simulator with uncertainty propagated via posterior samples of the model components. After calibration, we simulate seasons both on-policy and under altered policies and explore the net changes in efficiency and production under the alternate policies. Additionally, we discuss the game-theoretic ramifications of testing alternative decision policies.
"An Optimal Assistive Control Strategy based on User's Motor Goal

We estimate the movement intention by observing human user's joint angle, angluar velocity, and muscle activities for very short period of time. A task-related low-dimensional feature space is extracted from the observed user's movement data. We assume that discrete number of optimal control laws associated to different target tasks are pre-computed. Then, the optimal assistive policy is derived by blending the pre-computed optimal control laws based on the linear Bellman combination method. Coefficients that determine how to blend the control laws are derived based on the low-dimensional feature value that represents the user's movement intention. To validate our proposed method, we conducted basketball throwing tasks. In these experiments, subjects were asked to throw a basketball into a hoop placed at different throwing distances. The distances from the throwing point to the hoop were estimated as the user's movement intention and the optimal control policies were derived by using our proposed method. The results showed that the basketball throwing performances of the subjects were mostly improved.

These tools are studied by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study of simulated basketball games, and demonstrated in an application to evaluate the continuously updated forecasts published by the United States-based multinational sports network ESPN on its principle webpage {\tt espn.com}. This application lends statistical evidence that the forecasts published there are well-calibrated, and exhibit improved skill over several na\""ive models, but do not demonstrate significantly improved skill over simple logistic regression models based solely on a measurement of each teams' relative strength, and the evolving score difference throughout the game."

The proposed method adopts a mixture of finite mixtures framework and fully utilizes the spatial information via a mixture of matrix normal distribution representation. We propose an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling that allows simultaneous inference on both the number of clusters and the cluster configurations. We also establish large sample convergence properties for the posterior distribution. The excellent empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation studies and an application to shot chart data from selected players in the 2017 18 NBA regular season.

In order to have a deep understanding of field goal attempts among different players, we propose a zero inflated Poisson model with clustered regression coefficients to learn the shooting habits of different players over the court and the heterogeneity among them. Specifically, the zero inflated model recovers the large proportion of the court with zero field goal attempts, and the mixture of finite mixtures model learn the heterogeneity among different players based on clustered regression coefficients and inflated probabilities. Both theoretical and empirical justification through simulation studies validate our proposed method. We apply our proposed model to the National Basketball Association (NBA), for learning players' shooting habits and heterogeneity among different players over the 2017--2018 regular season. This illustrates our model as a way of providing insights from different aspects.

Recent work has explored the efficacy of traditional deep sequential models in this domain, but these architectures are slow and cumbersome to train, particularly as model size increases. Further, prior attempts to model interactions between agents across time have limitations, such as imposing an order on the agents, or making assumptions about their relationships. In this paper, we introduce baller2vec, a multi-entity generalization of the standard Transformer that can, with minimal assumptions, simultaneously and efficiently integrate information across entities and time. We test the effectiveness of baller2vec for multi-agent spatiotemporal modeling by training it to perform two different basketball-related tasks: (1) simultaneously modeling the trajectories of all players on the court and (2) modeling the trajectory of the ball. Not only does baller2vec learn to perform these tasks well (outperforming a graph recurrent neural network with a similar number of parameters by a wide margin), it also appears to ""understand"" the game of basketball, encoding idiosyncratic qualities of players in its embeddings, and performing basketball-relevant functions with its attention heads."

Our goal is to understand the advantages and concerns of applying immersive visualization to real-world skill-based sports training and to provide insights for designing AR sports training systems. We design both a situated 3D visualization on a head-mounted display and a 2D visualization on a co-located display to provide immediate visual feedback on a player's shot performance. Using a within-subject study design with experienced basketball shooters, we characterize user goals, report on qualitative training experiences, and compare the quantitative training results. Our results show that real-time visual feedback helps athletes refine subsequent shots. Shooters in our study achieve greater angle consistency with our visual feedback. Furthermore, AR visualization promotes an increased focus on body form in athletes. Finally, we present suggestions for the design of future sports AR studies.

Starting from the point at which the Division 1 tournaments and any unfinished conference tournaments were cancelled, we deliver closed-form probabilities for each team of making the Division 1 tournaments, had they not been cancelled, aided by use of conformal predictive distributions. We also deliver probabilities of a team winning March Madness, given a tournament bracket. We then compare single-game win probabilities generated with conformal predictive distributions, aptly named conformal win probabilities, to those generated through linear and logistic regression on seven years of historical college basketball data, specifically from the 2014-2015 season through the 2020-2021 season. Conformal win probabilities are shown to be better calibrated than other methods, resulting in more accurate win probability estimates, while requiring fewer distributional assumptions.

In broadcast basketball videos, specific camera motions are used to present specific events. Therefore, a semantic event in broadcast basketball videos is closely related to both the global motion (camera motion) and the collective motion. A semantic event in basketball videos can be generally divided into three stages: pre-event, event occurrence (event-occ), and post-event. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based global and collective motion pattern (On_GCMP) algorithm for basketball event classification. First, a two-stage GCMP based event classification scheme is proposed. The GCMP is extracted using optical flow. The two-stage scheme progressively combines a five-class event classification algorithm on event-occs and a two-class event classification algorithm on pre-events. Both algorithms utilize sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract the spatial and temporal features of GCMP for event classification. Second, we utilize post-event segments to predict success/failure using deep features of images in the video frames (RGB_DF_VF) based algorithms. Finally the event classification results and success/failure classification results are integrated to obtain the final results. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we collected a new dataset called NCAA+, which is automatically obtained from the NCAA dataset by extending the fixed length of video clips forward and backward of the corresponding semantic events. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the mean average precision of 58.10% on NCAA+. It is higher by 6.50% than state-of-the-art on NCAA.

The level of NBA teams improve each season. They incorporate to their rosters the best players in the world. These and other mechanisms, make the scoring in the NBA basketball games be something exciting, where, on rare occasions, we really know what will be the result at the end of the game. We analyzed all the games of the 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2009-10 NBA regular seasons (6150 games). We have studied the evolution of the scoring and the time intervals between points. These do not behave uniformly, but present more predictable areas. In turn, we have analyzed the scoring in the games regarding the differences in points. Exists different areas of behavior related with the scorea and each zone has a different nature. There are point that we can consider as tipping points. The presence of these critical points suggests that there are phase transitions where the dynamic scoring of the games varies significantly.
"A PageRank Model for Player Performance Assessment in Basketball, Soccer
  and Hockey";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110070>];2017-03-31 16:03:40;http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00583v1;"In the sports of soccer, hockey and basketball the most commonly used statistics for player performance assessment are divided into two categories: offensive statistics and defensive statistics. However, qualitative assessments of playmaking (for example making ""smart"" passes) are difficult to quantify. It would be advantageous to have available a single statistic that can emphasize the flow of a game, rewarding those players who initiate and contribute to successful plays more. In this paper we will examine a model based on Google's PageRank. Other papers have explored ranking teams, coaches, and captains but here we construct ratings and rankings for individual members on both teams that emphasizes initiating and partaking in successful plays and forcing defensive turnovers. For a soccer/hockey/basketball game, our model assigns a node for each of the n players who play in the game and a ""goal node"". Arcs between player nodes indicate sport-specific situations (including passes, turnovers, scoring, fouls, out-of-bounds, play-stoppages, turnovers, missed shots, defensive plays etc.), tailored for each sport. As well, some additional arcs are added in to ensure that the associated matrix is primitive and hence there is a unique PageRank vector. The PageRank vector of the associated matrix is used to rank the players of the game. To illustrate the model, data was taken from nine NBA games played between 2014-2016. Many of the top-ranked players (in the model) in a given game had some of the most impressive traditional stat-lines. However, from the model there were surprises where some players who had impressive stat-lines had lower ranks, and others who had less impressive stat-lines had higher ranks. Overall, the model's ranking and ratings reflect more the flow of the game compared to traditional sports statistics."
A bijective study of Basketball walks;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721101C0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110220>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110280>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721102E0>];2016-11-04 18:20:59;http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01478v2;The Catalan numbers count many classes of combinatorial objects. The most emblematic such objects are probably the Dyck walks and the binary trees, and, whenever another class of combinatorial objects is counted by the Catalan numbers, it is natural to search for an explicit bijection between the latter objects and one of the former objects. In most cases, such a bijection happens to be relatively simple but it might sometimes be more intricate.   In this work, we focus on so-called \emph{basketball walks}, which are integer-valued walks with step-set $\{-2,-1,+1,+2\}$. The presence of $-2$ as an allowed step makes it impossible to use the classical {\L}ukasiewicz encoding of trees by integer-valued walks, and thus a different strategy is needed. We give an explicit bijection that maps, for each $n\ge 2$, $n$-step basketball walks from $0$ to $0$ that visit $1$ and are positive except at their extremities to $n$-leaf binary trees. Moreover, we can partition the steps of a walk into $\pm 1$-steps, odd $+2$-steps or even $-2$-steps, and odd $-2$-steps or even $+2$-steps, and these three types of steps are mapped through our bijection to double leaves, left leaves, and right leaves of the corresponding tree.   We also prove that basketball walks from $0$ to $1$ that are positive except at the origin are in bijection with increasing unary-binary trees with associated permutation avoiding $213$. We furthermore give the refined generating function of these objects with an extra variable accounting for the unary nodes.
Measuring Spatial Allocative Efficiency in Basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721103D0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110430>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110490>];2019-12-11 05:56:55;http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/jqas-2019-0126;"Every shot in basketball has an opportunity cost; one player's shot eliminates all potential opportunities from their teammates for that play. For this reason, player-shot efficiency should ultimately be considered relative to the lineup. This aspect of efficiency---the optimal way to allocate shots within a lineup---is the focus of our paper. Allocative efficiency should be considered in a spatial context since the distribution of shot attempts within a lineup is highly dependent on court location. We propose a new metric for spatial allocative efficiency by comparing a player's field goal percentage (FG%) to their field goal attempt (FGA) rate in context of both their four teammates on the court and the spatial distribution of their shots. Leveraging publicly available data provided by the National Basketball Association (NBA), we estimate player FG% at every location in the offensive half court using a Bayesian hierarchical model. Then, by ordering a lineup's estimated FG%s and pairing these rankings with the lineup's empirical FGA rate rankings, we detect areas where the lineup exhibits inefficient shot allocation. Lastly, we analyze the impact that sub-optimal shot allocation has on a team's overall offensive potential, demonstrating that inefficient shot allocation correlates with reduced scoring."

For a marked spatial point process, this means that the mark and the intensity are associated. We propose a Bayesian joint model for the mark and the intensity of marked point processes, where the intensity is incorporated in the mark model as a covariate. Inferences are done with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Two Bayesian model comparison criteria, the Deviance Information Criterion and the Logarithm of the Pseudo-Marginal Likelihood, were used to assess the model. The performances of the proposed methods were examined in extensive simulation studies. The proposed methods were applied to the shot charts of four players (Curry, Harden, Durant, and James) in the 2017--2018 regular season of the National Basketball Association to analyze their shot intensity in the field and the field goal percentage in detail. Application to the top 50 most frequent shooters in the season suggests that the field goal percentage and the shot intensity are positively associated for a majority of the players. The fitted parameters were used as inputs in a secondary analysis to cluster the players into different groups.

Compared with image-based action recognition, videos provide much more information. Reducing the ambiguity of actions and in the last decade, many works focused on datasets, novel models and learning approaches have improved video action recognition to a higher level. However, there are challenges and unsolved problems, in particular in sports analytics where data collection and labeling are more sophisticated, requiring sport professionals to annotate data. In addition, the actions could be extremely fast and it becomes difficult to recognize them. Moreover, in team sports like football and basketball, one action could involve multiple players, and to correctly recognize them, we need to analyse all players, which is relatively complicated. In this paper, we present a survey on video action recognition for sports analytics. We introduce more than ten types of sports, including team sports, such as football, basketball, volleyball, hockey and individual sports, such as figure skating, gymnastics, table tennis, tennis, diving and badminton. Then we compare numerous existing frameworks for sports analysis to present status quo of video action recognition in both team sports and individual sports. Finally, we discuss the challenges and unsolved problems in this area and to facilitate sports analytics, we develop a toolbox using PaddlePaddle, which supports football, basketball, table tennis and figure skating action recognition.
"Group Activity Recognition in Basketball Tracking Data -- Neural
  Embeddings in Team Sports (NETS)";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110AC0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472110B20>];2022-08-31 01:22:38;http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00451v1;Like many team sports, basketball involves two groups of players who engage in collaborative and adversarial activities to win a game. Players and teams are executing various complex strategies to gain an advantage over their opponents. Defining, identifying, and analyzing different types of activities is an important task in sports analytics, as it can lead to better strategies and decisions by the players and coaching staff. The objective of this paper is to automatically recognize basketball group activities from tracking data representing locations of players and the ball during a game. We propose a novel deep learning approach for group activity recognition (GAR) in team sports called NETS. To efficiently model the player relations in team sports, we combined a Transformer-based architecture with LSTM embedding, and a team-wise pooling layer to recognize the group activity. Training such a neural network generally requires a large amount of annotated data, which incurs high labeling cost. To address scarcity of manual labels, we generate weak-labels and pretrain the neural network on a self-supervised trajectory prediction task. We used a large tracking data set from 632 NBA games to evaluate our approach. The results show that NETS is capable of learning group activities with high accuracy, and that self- and weak-supervised training in NETS have a positive impact on GAR accuracy.

In order to analyze the intermediate cases, a distribution, the q-Weibull one, which interpolates the q-exponential and Weibull ones, is introduced. It is verified that the basketball baskets distribution is well described by a q-exponential, whereas the cyclone victims and brand-name drugs by retail sales ones are better adjusted by a Weibull distribution. On the other hand, for highway length the q-exponential and Weibull distributions do not give satisfactory adjustment, being necessary to employ the q-Weibull distribution. Furthermore, the introduction of this interpolating distribution gives an illumination from the point of view of the stretched exponential against inverse power law (q-exponential with q > 1) controversy.

Typically, NBA players are discussed and compared in an heuristic, imprecise manner that relies on unmeasured intuitions about player behavior. This makes it difficult to draw comparisons between players and make accurate player specific predictions. Modeling shot attempt data as a point process, we create a low dimensional representation of offensive player types in the NBA. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, we show that a low-rank spatial decomposition summarizes the shooting habits of NBA players. The spatial representations discovered by the algorithm correspond to intuitive descriptions of NBA player types, and can be used to model other spatial effects, such as shooting accuracy.
On Optimal Offensive Strategies in Basketball;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721111F0>];2015-06-22 17:17:15;http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06687v2;The purpose of this paper is to determine whether basketball teams who choose to employ an offensive strategy that involves predominantly shooting three point shots is stable and optimal. We employ a game-theoretical approach using techniques from dynamical systems theory to show that taking more three point shots to a point where an offensive strategy is dependent on predominantly shooting threes is not necessarily optimal, and depends on a combination of payoff constraints, where one can establish conditions via the global stability of equilibrium points in addition to Nash equilibria where a predominant two-point offensive strategy would be optimal as well. We perform a detailed fixed-points analysis to establish the local stability of a given offensive strategy. We finally prove the existence of Nash equilibria via global stability techniques via the monotonicity principle. We believe that this work demonstrates that the concept that teams should attempt more three-point shots because a three-point shot is worth more than a two-point shot is therefore, a highly ambiguous statement.
Applying Deep Learning to Basketball Trajectories;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111340>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721113A0>];2016-08-12 13:50:24;http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03793v2;One of the emerging trends for sports analytics is the growing use of player and ball tracking data. A parallel development is deep learning predictive approaches that use vast quantities of data with less reliance on feature engineering. This paper applies recurrent neural networks in the form of sequence modeling to predict whether a three-point shot is successful. The models are capable of learning the trajectory of a basketball without any knowledge of physics. For comparison, a baseline static machine learning model with a full set of features, such as angle and velocity, in addition to the positional data is also tested. Using a dataset of over 20,000 three pointers from NBA SportVu data, the models based simply on sequential positional data outperform a static feature rich machine learning model in predicting whether a three-point shot is successful. This suggests deep learning models may offer an improvement to traditional feature based machine learning methods for tracking data.

This is a challenging task that requires inferring the camera wearer's visual attention, and decoding the social cues of other players. Our key observation is that a first-person view provides strong cues to infer the camera wearer's momentary visual attention, and his/her intentions. We exploit this observation by proposing a new cross-model EgoSupervision learning scheme that allows us to predict with whom the camera wearer will cooperate in the near future, without using manually labeled intention labels. Our cross-model EgoSupervision operates by transforming the outputs of a pretrained pose-estimation network, into pseudo ground truth labels, which are then used as a supervisory signal to train a new network for a cooperative intention task. We evaluate our method, and show that it achieves similar or even better accuracy than the fully supervised methods do.

We propose a method to summarize the huge amount of information collected at different aspects of a sport team which is almost daily publicly available. The tool will allow agents involved in a player's negotiation to show the strengths (and weaknesses) of the player with respect to other players. The approach is based on applying a multicriteria outranking methodology using as alternatives the potential players and criteria different efficiency indices. A novel automatic parameter tuning approach is detailed that will allow coaches and sports managers to design templates and sports strategies that improve the efficiency of their teams. We report the results performed over the available information on the ACB Basketball League, and we show how it can be easily implemented and interpreted in practice by decision-makers non familiar with the mathematical side of the methodology.
Leveraging Contextual Cues for Generating Basketball Highlights;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111790>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721117F0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111850>];2016-06-29 05:04:27;http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08955v1;The massive growth of sports videos has resulted in a need for automatic generation of sports highlights that are comparable in quality to the hand-edited highlights produced by broadcasters such as ESPN. Unlike previous works that mostly use audio-visual cues derived from the video, we propose an approach that additionally leverages contextual cues derived from the environment that the game is being played in. The contextual cues provide information about the excitement levels in the game, which can be ranked and selected to automatically produce high-quality basketball highlights. We introduce a new dataset of 25 NCAA games along with their play-by-play stats and the ground-truth excitement data for each basket. We explore the informativeness of five different cues derived from the video and from the environment through user studies. Our experiments show that for our study participants, the highlights produced by our system are comparable to the ones produced by ESPN for the same games.
Defensive Player Classification in the National Basketball Association;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721118E0>];2016-12-13 20:22:00;http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05502v2;The National Basketball Association(NBA) has expanded their data gathering and have heavily invested in new technologies to gather advanced performance metrics on players. This expanded data set allows analysts to use unique performance metrics in models to estimate and classify player performance. Instead of grouping players together based on physical attributes and positions played, analysts can group together players that play similar to each other based on these tracked metrics. Existing methods for player classification have typically used offensive metrics for clustering [1]. There have been attempts to classify players using past defensive metrics, but the lack of quality metrics has not produced promising results. The classifications presented in the paper use newly introduced defensive metrics to find different defensive positions for each player. Without knowing the number of categories that players can be cast into, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be applied to find the optimal number of clusters. In the model presented, five different defensive player types can be identified.
"Prediction of the margin of victory only from team rankings for regular
  season games in NCAA men's basketball";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111A30>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111A90>];2017-01-25 14:07:52;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1754337117754181;"The main objective of this paper is to investigate the extent to which the margin of victory can be predicted solely by the rankings of the opposing teams in NCAA Division I men's basketball games. Several past studies have modeled this relationship for the games played during the March Madness tournament, and this work aims at verifying if the models advocated in these papers still perform well for regular season games. Indeed, most previous articles have shown that a simple quadratic regression model provides fairly accurate predictions of the margin of victory when team rankings only range from 1 to 16. Does that still hold true when team rankings can go as high as 351? Do the model assumptions hold? Can we find semi- or non-parametric methods that yield even better results (i.e. predicted margins of victory that more closely resemble actual results)? The analyses presented in this paper suggest that the answer is ""yes"" on all three counts!"
Random Basketball Routing for ZigBee based Sensor Networks;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111B80>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111BE0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111C40>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111CA0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111D00>];2013-12-20 02:35:38;http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5794v1;Random basketball routing (BR) \cite {Hwang} is a simple protocol that integrates MAC and multihop routing in a cross-layer optimized manner. Due to its lightness and performance, BR would be quite suitable for sensor networks, where communication nodes are usually simple devices. In this paper, we describe how we implemented BR in a ZigBee-based (IEEE 802.15.4) sensor network. In \cite{Hwang}, it is verified that BR takes advantages of dynamic environments (in particular, node mobility), however, here we focus on how BR works under static situations. For implementation purposes, we add some features such as destination RSSI measuring and loop-free procedure, to the original BR. With implemented testbed, we compare the performance of BR with that of the simplified AODV with CSMA/CA. The result is that BR has merits in terms of number of hops to traverse the network. Considering the simple structure of BR and its possible energy-efficiency, we can conclude that BR can be a good candidate for sensor networks both under dynamic- and static environments.
"Does the winning team always covers the point spread? A study in

Since, a winner team might not cover a bet.   This study focuses on the relation of the variable win to the betting variable cover the point spread. The study is performed with data from professional basketball (betting lines and scores) and tries to answer the question: Does the winning team always covers the point spread?. In order to answer this question, a regression analysis is performed taking into account the most and less winning teams, together with their betting variables since the 1990-1991 NBA season. The regression results are inserted in the SPXS expert system revealing an indirect factor analysis that correlates betting variables with teams winning percentages.
"Detecting and classifying moments in basketball matches using sensor
  tracked data";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111EE0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111F40>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472111FA0>];2019-06-27 15:06:46;http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11720v1;Data analytics in sports is crucial to evaluate the performance of single players and the whole team. The literature proposes a number of tools for both offence and defence scenarios. Data coming from tracking location of players, in this respect, may be used to enrich the amount of useful information. In basketball, however, actions are interleaved with inactive periods. This paper describes a methodological approach to automatically identify active periods during a game and to classify them as offensive or defensive. The method is based on the application of thresholds to players kinematic parameters, whose values undergo a tuning strategy similar to Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, using a ground truth extracted from the video of the games.
Multi-Person tracking by multi-scale detection in Basketball scenarios;[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F0D0>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F130>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F190>];2019-07-10 11:56:35;http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04637v1;Tracking data is a powerful tool for basketball teams in order to extract advanced semantic information and statistics that might lead to a performance boost. However, multi-person tracking is a challenging task to solve in single-camera video sequences, given the frequent occlusions and cluttering that occur in a restricted scenario. In this paper, a novel multi-scale detection method is presented, which is later used to extract geometric and content features, resulting in a multi-person video tracking system. Having built a dataset from scratch together with its ground truth (more than 10k bounding boxes), standard metrics are evaluated, obtaining notable results both in terms of detection (F1-score) and tracking (MOTA). The presented system could be used as a source of data gathering in order to extract useful statistics and semantic analyses a posteriori.
"Why Can't I Dance in the Mall? Learning to Mitigate Scene Bias in Action

Training a model using existing video datasets thus inevitably captures and leverages such bias (instead of using the actual discriminative cues). The learned representation may not generalize well to new action classes or different tasks. In this paper, we propose to mitigate scene bias for video representation learning. Specifically, we augment the standard cross-entropy loss for action classification with 1) an adversarial loss for scene types and 2) a human mask confusion loss for videos where the human actors are masked out. These two losses encourage learning representations that are unable to predict the scene types and the correct actions when there is no evidence. We validate the effectiveness of our method by transferring our pre-trained model to three different tasks, including action classification, temporal localization, and spatio-temporal action detection. Our results show consistent improvement over the baseline model without debiasing.
"Bayesian Group Learning for Shot Selection of Professional Basketball
  Players";[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F490>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F4F0>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F550>];2020-06-12 23:49:08;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sta4.324;In this paper, we develop a group learning approach to analyze the underlying heterogeneity structure of shot selection among professional basketball players in the NBA. We propose a mixture of finite mixtures (MFM) model to capture the heterogeneity of shot selection among different players based on Log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP). Our proposed method can simultaneously estimate the number of groups and group configurations. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for our proposed model. Simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate its performance. Ultimately, our proposed learning approach is further illustrated in analyzing shot charts of several players in the NBA's 2017-2018 regular season.
The physics of an optimal basketball free throw;[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F5E0>];2017-02-21 23:50:33;http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07234v1;A physical model is developed, which suggests a pathway to determining the optimal release conditions for a basketball free throw. Theoretical framework is supported by Monte Carlo simulations and a series of free throws performed and analysed at Southbank International School. The model defines a smile-shaped success region in angle-velocity space where a free throw will score. A formula for the minimum throwing angle is derived analytically. The optimal throwing conditions are determined numerically by maximising the expected number of successful shots given the error pattern inherent to the player. This approach is fully quantified by the model presented and suggests a reliable way for individual free throw improvement. The model also explains recent NBA data showing that some of the most successful free throwers bear completely different conditions to the average player.
"Players Movements and Team Shooting Performance: a Data Mining approach
  for Basketball";[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210F6D0>];2018-05-04 09:49:18;http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.02501v1;In the domain of Sport Analytics, Global Positioning Systems devices are intensively used as they permit to retrieve players' movements. Team sports' managers and coaches are interested on the relation between players' patterns of movements and team performance, in order to better manage their team. In this paper we propose a Cluster Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling approach to find and describe separate patterns of players movements. Using real data of multiple professional basketball teams, we find, consistently over different case studies, that in the defensive clusters players are close one to another while the transition cluster are characterized by a large space among them. Moreover, we find the pattern of players' positioning that produce the best shooting performance.

We leverage game data to build networks of pairwise interactions between the head coaches of the teams, and measure their career performance in terms of network centrality metrics. We identify Arsene Wenger, Sir Alex Ferguson, Jupp Heynckes, Carlo Ancelotti, and Jose Mourinho as the top 5 European soccer coaches of all time. In American basketball, the first 5 positions of the all-time ranking are occupied by Red Auerbach, Gregg Popovich, Phil Jackson, Don Nelson, and Lenny Wilkens. We further establish rankings by decade and season. We develop a simple methodology to monitor performance throughout a coach's career, and to dynamically compare the performance of two or more coaches at a given time.

As a result, the trajectories of the agents are often statistically dependent at any given time step; however, almost universally, multi-agent models implicitly assume the agents' trajectories are statistically independent at each time step. In this paper, we introduce baller2vec++, a multi-entity Transformer that can effectively model coordinated agents. Specifically, baller2vec++ applies a specially designed self-attention mask to a mixture of location and ""look-ahead"" trajectory sequences to learn the distributions of statistically dependent agent trajectories. We show that, unlike baller2vec (baller2vec++'s predecessor), baller2vec++ can learn to emulate the behavior of perfectly coordinated agents in a simulated toy dataset. Additionally, when modeling the trajectories of professional basketball players, baller2vec++ outperforms baller2vec by a wide margin."

Our method is fully probabilistic; hence allows simultaneous inference on both the number of clusters and the cluster configurations. We present an efficient posterior sampling method and establish the large-sample convergence properties for the posterior distribution. Simulation studies have demonstrated an excellent empirical performance of the proposed method. Finally, an application to shot chart data collected from 191 NBA players during the 2017-2018 regular season is conducted and reveals several interesting insights for basketball analytics."
KaliCalib: A Framework for Basketball Court Registration;[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210FC70>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210FCD0>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210FD30>];2022-09-16 08:52:29;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3552437.3555701;Tracking the players and the ball in team sports is key to analyse the performance or to enhance the game watching experience with augmented reality. When the only sources for this data are broadcast videos, sports-field registration systems are required to estimate the homography and re-project the ball or the players from the image space to the field space. This paper describes a new basketball court registration framework in the context of the MMSports 2022 camera calibration challenge. The method is based on the estimation by an encoder-decoder network of the positions of keypoints sampled with perspective-aware constraints. The regression of the basket positions and heavy data augmentation techniques make the model robust to different arenas. Ablation studies show the positive effects of our contributions on the challenge test set. Our method divides the mean squared error by 4.7 compared to the challenge baseline.

  Data";[<Author.Author object at 0x000002047210FE20>, <Author.Author object at 0x000002047210FE80>];2017-12-04 17:06:11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01199v5;During the past few years advancements in sports information systems and technology has allowed us to collect a number of detailed spatio-temporal data capturing various aspects of basketball. For example, shot charts, that is, maps capturing locations of (made or missed) shots, and spatio-temporal trajectories for all the players on the court can capture information about the offensive and defensive tendencies and schemes of a team. Characterization of these processes is important for player and team comparisons, pre-game scouting, game preparation etc. Playing tendencies among teams have traditionally been compared in a heuristic manner. Recently automated ways for similar comparisons have appeared in the sports analytics literature. However, these approaches are almost exclusively focused on the spatial distribution of the underlying actions (usually shots taken), ignoring a multitude of other parameters that can affect the action studied. In this work, we propose a framework based on tensor decomposition for obtaining a set of prototype spatio-temporal patterns based on the core spatiotemporal information and contextual meta-data. The core of our framework is a 3D tensor X, whose dimensions represent the entity under consideration (team, player, possession etc.), the location on the court and time. We make use of the PARAFAC decomposition and we decompose the tensor into several interpretable patterns, that can be thought of as prototype patterns of the process examined (e.g., shot selection, offensive schemes etc.). We also introduce an approach for choosing the number of components to be considered. Using the tensor components, we can then express every entity as a weighted combination of these components. The framework introduced in this paper can have further applications in the work-flow of the basketball operations of a franchise, which we also briefly discuss.

In particular, we study permutation tests of the null hypothesis of randomness (i.e., that trials are i.i.d.) based on test statistics that compare the proportion of successes that directly follow k consecutive successes with either the overall proportion of successes or the proportion of successes that directly follow k consecutive failures. We characterize the asymptotic distributions of these test statistics and their permutation distributions under randomness, under a set of general stationary processes, and under a class of Markov chain alternatives, which allow us to derive their local asymptotic power. The results are applied to evaluate the empirical support for the hot hand fallacy provided by four controlled basketball shooting experiments. We establish that substantially larger data sets are required to derive an informative measurement of the deviation from randomness in basketball shooting. In one experiment, for which we were able to obtain data, multiple testing procedures reveal that one shooter exhibits a shooting pattern significantly inconsistent with randomness - supplying strong evidence that basketball shooting is not random for all shooters all of the time. However, we find that the evidence against randomness in this experiment is limited to this shooter. Our results provide a mathematical and statistical foundation for the design and validation of experiments that directly compare deviations from randomness with human beliefs about deviations from randomness, and thereby constitute a direct test of the hot hand fallacy.

The approach to equilibrium, as well as the kinetic and chemical equilibration is investigated.

Archetypal Athletes;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472113640>];2011-10-10 09:31:40;http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.1972v1;Discussions on outstanding---positively and/or negatively---athletes are common practice. The rapidly grown amount of collected sports data now allow to support such discussions with state of the art statistical methodology. Given a (multivariate) data set with collected data of athletes within a specific sport, outstanding athletes are values on the data set boundary. In the present paper we propose archetypal analysis to compute these extreme values. The so-called archetypes, i.e., archetypal athletes, approximate the observations as convex combinations. We interpret the archetypal athletes and their characteristics, and, furthermore, the composition of all athletes based on the archetypal athletes. The application of archetypal analysis is demonstrated on basketball statistics and soccer skill ratings.

However, it is difficult, especially in low-resolution images, due to the small size of the ball, its speed that creates motion blur, and its often being occluded by players. In this paper, we propose a generic and principled approach to modeling the interaction between the ball and the players while also imposing appropriate physical constraints on the ball's trajectory. We show that our approach, formulated in terms of a Mixed Integer Program, is more robust and more accurate than several state-of-the-art approaches on real-life volleyball, basketball, and soccer sequences.

Discrete distributions from a Markov chain;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472113FA0>];2020-06-24 14:26:33;http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13766v1;A discrete-time stochastic process derived from a model of basketball is used to generalize any discrete distribution. The generalized distributions can have one or two more parameters than the parent distribution. Those derived from binomial, Poisson and negative binomial distributions can be underdispersed or overdispersed. The mean can be simply expressed in terms of model parameters, thus making inference for the mean straightforward. Probabilities can be quickly computed, enabling likelihood-based inference. Random number generation is also straightforward. The properties of some of the new distributions are described and their use is illustrated with examples.
Functional Ratings in Sports;[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115130>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115190>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721151F0>];2019-08-02 16:15:40;http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00939v1;In this paper, we present a new model for ranking sports teams. Our model uses all scoring data from all games to produce a functional rating by the method of least squares. The functional rating can be interpreted as a teams average point differential adjusted for strength of schedule. Using two team's functional ratings we can predict the expected point differential at any time in the game. We looked at three variations of our model accounting for home-court advantage in different ways. We use the 2018-2019 NCAA Division 1 men's college basketball season to test the models and determined that home-court advantage is statistically important but does not differ between teams.
The Hot Hand and Its Effect on the NBA;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721152E0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115340>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721153A0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115400>];2020-10-29 20:59:33;http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15943v1;"This paper aims to revisit and expand upon previous work on the ""hot hand"" phenomenon in basketball, specifically in the NBA. Using larger, modern data sets, we test streakiness of shooting patterns and the presence of hot hand behavior in free throw shooting, while going further by examining league-wide hot hand trends and the changes in individual player behavior. Additionally, we perform simulations in order to assess their power. While we find no evidence of the hot hand in game-play and only weak evidence in free throw trials, we find that some NBA players exhibit behavioral changes based on the outcome of their previous shot."
"A Gold Standard Methodology for Evaluating Accuracy in Data-To-Text
  Systems";[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721154F0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115550>];2020-11-08 14:49:18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03992v1;Most Natural Language Generation systems need to produce accurate texts. We propose a methodology for high-quality human evaluation of the accuracy of generated texts, which is intended to serve as a gold-standard for accuracy evaluations of data-to-text systems. We use our methodology to evaluate the accuracy of computer generated basketball summaries. We then show how our gold standard evaluation can be used to validate automated metrics
Features selection in NBA outcome prediction through Deep Learning;[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721155E0>];2021-11-17 16:32:11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09695v1;This manuscript is focused on features' definition for the outcome prediction of matches of NBA basketball championship. It is shown how models based on one a single feature (Elo rating or the relative victory frequency) have a quality of fit better than models using box-score predictors (e.g. the Four Factors). Features have been ex ante calculated for a dataset containing data of 16 NBA regular seasons, paying particular attention to home court factor. Models have been produced via Deep Learning, using cross validation.
"Measuring dependencies between variables of a dynamical system using
  fuzzy affiliations";[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721156D0>];2022-03-11 15:16:56;http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05993v1;A statistical, data-driven method is presented that quantifies influences between variables of a dynamical system. The method is based on finding a suitable representation of points by fuzzy affiliations with respect to landmark points using the Scalable Probabilistic Approximation algorithm. This is followed by the construction of a linear mapping between these affiliations for different variables and forward in time. This linear mapping can be directly interpreted in light of unidirectional dependencies and relevant properties of it are quantified. These quantifications then serve as measures for the influences between variables of the dynamics. The validity of the method is demonstrated with theoretical results and on several numerical examples, including real-world basketball player movement.
"Bayesian estimation of in-game home team win probability for college
  basketball";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115820>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115880>, <Author.Author object at 0x00000204721158E0>];2022-04-25 16:46:47;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11777v1;Two new Bayesian methods for estimating and predicting in-game home team win probabilities are proposed. The first method has a prior that adjusts as a function of lead differential and time elapsed. The second is an adjusted version of the first, where the adjustment is a linear combination of the Bayesian estimator with a time-weighted pre-game win probability. The proposed methods are compared to existing methods, showing the new methods perform better for both estimation and prediction. The utility is illustrated via an application to the 2016 NCAA Division 1 Championship game.
"Bayesian estimation of in-game home team win probability for Division-I
  FBS college football";[<Author.Author object at 0x00000204721159D0>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115A30>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115A90>];2022-07-27 18:51:51;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13747v1;Maddox, et al. [9, 10] establish Bayesian methods for estimating home-team in-game win probability for college and NBA basketball. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach for estimating in-game home-team win probability for Division-I FBS college (American) football that uses expected number of remaining possessions and expected score as two predictors. Models for estimating these are presented and compared. These, along with other predictors are introduced into two Bayesian approaches for the final estimate of in-game home-team win probability. To illustrate utility, methods are applied to the 2021 Big XII Conference Football Championship game between Baylor and Oklahoma State.
"Adjusted Plus-Minus for NHL Players using Ridge Regression with Goals,
  Shots, Fenwick, and Corsi";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115B20>];2012-01-01 00:13:03;http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/1559-0410.1447;Regression-based adjusted plus-minus statistics were developed in basketball and have recently come to hockey. The purpose of these statistics is to provide an estimate of each player's contribution to his team, independent of the strength of his teammates, the strength of his opponents, and other variables that are out of his control. One of the main downsides of the ordinary least squares regression models is that the estimates have large error bounds. Since certain pairs of teammates play together frequently, collinearity is present in the data and is one reason for the large errors. In hockey, the relative lack of scoring compared to basketball is another reason. To deal with these issues, we use ridge regression, a method that is commonly used in lieu of ordinary least squares regression when collinearity is present in the data. We also create models that use not only goals, but also shots, Fenwick rating (shots plus missed shots), and Corsi rating (shots, missed shots, and blocked shots). One benefit of using these statistics is that there are roughly ten times as many shots as goals, so there is much more data when using these statistics and the resulting estimates have smaller error bounds. The results of our ridge regression models are estimates of the offensive and defensive contributions of forwards and defensemen during even strength, power play, and short handed situations, in terms of goals per 60 minutes. The estimates are independent of strength of teammates, strength of opponents, and the zone in which a player's shift begins.
"Who's good this year? Comparing the Information Content of Games in the
  Four Major US Sports";[<Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115C70>, <Author.Author object at 0x0000020472115CD0>];2015-01-28 16:31:47;http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07179v1;"In the four major North American professional sports (baseball, basketball, football, and hockey), the primary purpose of the regular season is to determine which teams most deserve to advance to the playoffs. Interestingly, while the ultimate goal of identifying the best teams is the same, the number of regular season games played differs dramatically between the sports, ranging from 16 (football) to 82 (basketball and hockey) to 162 (baseball). Though length of season is partially determined by many factors including travel logistics, rest requirements, playoff structure and television contracts, it is hard to reconcile the 10-fold difference in the number of games between, for example, the NFL and MLB unless football games are somehow more ""informative"" than baseball games. In this paper, we aim to quantify the amount of information games yield about the relative strength of the teams involved. Our strategy is to assess how well simple paired comparison models fitted from $X%$ of the games within a season predict the outcomes of the remaining $(100-X)%$ of games, for multiple values of $X$. We compare the resulting predictive accuracy curves between seasons within the same sport and across all four sports, and find dramatic differences in the amount of information yielded by individual game results in the four major U.S. sports."
